Uncertainties surrounding the concentration of viral RNA fragments in the faeces of individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 poses a major challenge for wastewater-based surveillance of Covid-19. This repository serves to collate data from quantitative studies on RNA load in faecal samples to constrain the shedding distribution.

üìä Datasets
-----------

Datasets can be found in the ``publications`` directory as JSON files following a common schema (see ``schema.json`` for details). All RNA loads are reported as log10 gene copies per mL. The results from individual samples are linked to patients wherever possible to provide longitudional information.

   *Overview of viral RNA load data available in different publications.* Black vertical dotted lines represent the level of quantification or threshold for a sample to be considered positive. Arrows represent limits of viral RNA load reported in some studies. Squares and triangles represent the mean and median, respectively.
