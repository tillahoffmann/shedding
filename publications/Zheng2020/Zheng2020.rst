Zheng et al. followed 96 patients and analysed 3,497 specimen; stool samples were collected for 93 patients (private communication) of which 55 tested positive. Viral load data were extracted from Fig. 2. Each point corresponds to the median concentration aggregated for each patient (private communication). LOQ from the main text (although not exact).

.. note::

   Fig. 2 only contains 50 data points instead of the expected 55 data points. The effective number of patients was adjusted by the corresponding factor 50/55â‰ˆ0.91, giving rise to 50 patients with positive stool samples, 35 patients with negative stool samples, and 85 patients in total.
