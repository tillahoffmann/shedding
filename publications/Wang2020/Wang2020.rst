Wang et al. study 205 patients in three different hospitals, but data are only available for 20 patients of which 14 had stool samples analysed. Data and the level of quantification were obtained from Fig. 1 as cycle threshold values which were converted to viral load using the conversion reported in the main text (see ``convert_cycle_threshold.py`` for details).

.. note::

   Viral loads below the level of quantification are available in the data but should be treated with caution.
