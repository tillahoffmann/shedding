Jeong et al. consider RNA concentrations in the faeces of five patients. Data were extracted from Tbl. 2.

.. note::

   Viral RNA concentrations reported by this study are orders of magnitude lower compared with other studies for both nasopharyngeal and faecal samples. This may be a result of the custom S-specific primers used that are similar to ``NIID_WH-1_F24381``.
